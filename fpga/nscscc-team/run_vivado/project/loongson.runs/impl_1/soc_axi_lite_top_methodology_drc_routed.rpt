2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell fpga_pll.u_rst_cpu/FSM_onehot_state[5]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) fpga_pll.u_rst_cpu/delay_reg[0]/CLR, fpga_pll.u_rst_cpu/delay_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
